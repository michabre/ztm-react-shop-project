# ZTM React Shop Project

Developed as part of Zero To Mastery's course, **Complete React Developer in 2022 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)**.

For my own learning benefit, I have been converting the codebase into Typescript.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
# start development environment
# http://localhost:3000
npm start

# run tests
npm test

# build production ready version 
# files pushed to build folder
npm run build

# exposes all build scripts
# cannot be undone
npm run eject

```
